I forgo almost my vacation to work in LUT-EDA lab. I used to program on microchips like MCS51 and STM32.
I learned Arduino when I became TA in Fall 2021. I am always interested in programming on embedded systems. 
NVIDIA Jetson, Intel NUC in 2019, when I participated in Robomaster Robotics Competition. I would always enjoy this period.

I would like to appreciate [https://dianqi.lut.edu.cn/info/1150/3826.htm Prof Weirong Liu] for his kind supervision and teaching.
